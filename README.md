<h1 align="center">âœ¨ Wincoronaâœ¨</h1>

<p align="center">
Wincorona is an application developed by me for non profit during the 2nd phase of covid in India when there was a scarcity of oxygen, blood plasma and people were sharing information about oxygen and blood supplier over social media and it was really hard to keep track of those information. This app is design to solve that problem. The application allows to get information related to required items using pincode. Anyone can use their pincode and search oxygen, blood plasma etc and if the information is available it will be shown in the results. If users are not satisfied with the results then they can post in the ask for help section.

1. Search using Pincode to get relevant results. Input pincode and check required items to search and get results.
2. Register and Login to Contribute. Create an account if you want to contribute or post relevant information about suppliers and edit, update and delete posts according to preference.
3. Ask for Help. If you are not satisfied with the search results you can post your needs in public and anyone visiting the app can view your post and can help accordingly.
4. Contact. In case you want to contact the team or the developer, you can fill the form and post.
5. Admin Panel. Can view total number of contributions made, people requested for help, people trying to contact and total number of users in the dashboard section. Search contribution with pincode in the contribution list section. Can view and edit list of users registered and contact list.
